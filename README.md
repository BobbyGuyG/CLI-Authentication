## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to CLI-Authentication, a user-friendly tool for creating and managing users. This project offers both a public sign-up form and a secure method for developers to create users via a command line interface (CLI).

### üíª System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or above.
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js. Ensure it is updated.

After downloading, follow the next steps for installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

1. **Extract the Downloaded Files:** Locate the downloaded zip or tar file and extract it to your preferred location.

2. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:** 
   - On Windows, you can search for "Command Prompt" in the start menu.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Application:** Follow the instructions for user creation in the next section.

## üë• User Creation Methods

### 1. Public Sign-Up (Web Form)

This is the user-friendly sign-up form accessible through the web. Here, users can register easily by filling out their details on the form.

### 2. Secure Admin Creation (CLI Script)

This method is for developers who need to onboard users directly through a terminal.

- **How to run the CLI command:**
  
  Use the following command structure to create an admin user. Ensure to replace the placeholders with actual information.

  ```bash
  npm run create-admin -- \
   --email "new.admin@isp.com" \
   --password "AStrongP@ssw0rd!" \
   --ispName "Super Secure ISP" \
   --ownerName "Jane Doe"
  ```

This command uses parameters to create a new admin user. Each parameter has a specific purpose:

- `--email`: The email address for the new admin.
- `--password`: A strong password for account security.
- `--ispName`: The name of the internet service provider.
- `--ownerName`: The name of the admin owner.

### üõ† Functionality

The CLI script works directly with Firebase and Prisma to create secure user records, ensuring accuracy and security without the need for a web server.
